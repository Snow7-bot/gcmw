"""Agent API router (issue #36 / #36c — B2-B wiring round, review round 2).

Architecture rules enforced here:
- ``RunRepository`` (#65B-2 slice B2-A) is the ONLY authority for run state and
  events. **Every state decision reads it** — the idempotent-replay answer, the
  one-active-run-per-session admission check, status reads, cancels and stream
  authorisation. No local mirror is consulted, so a run finished by another
  component (ManagerAgent, another worker) immediately frees its session;
- the admission service keeps lifecycle bookkeeping only (session TTL,
  idempotency keys, payload hashes, the raw question snapshot) and never owns a
  sequence number or a state;
- admission is atomic per SESSION (one lock per session id): every invariant
  here is session-scoped, so a slow storage call for one session can never
  block another session's requests (no cross-tenant head-of-line blocking).
  The service lives in the FastAPI app/lifespan scope, i.e. exactly one event
  loop owns it; multi-process admission is explicitly NOT faked in memory (see
  :mod:`app.runtime` — staging/production fail closed until a persistent
  AdmissionStore exists);
- sessions expire on an injectable clock; expiry removes session, runs,
  idempotency entries and the raw question snapshots;
- tenant/device always derive from the DevicePrincipal (default deny); run
  ownership is checked once, before the stream response starts;
- session deletion is resumable: the durable record goes first and memory drops
  the run only after storage confirmed, so memory never claims a run storage no
  longer has — a mid-way failure keeps the session so the client can retry;
- this slice (B2-B) exposes the public SSE route only: no subscriber lease, no
  disconnect->cancel propagation and no reconnect grace (all B2-C).
